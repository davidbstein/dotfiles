========

everything in this is hacky or broken. Over 15 years of wedging stuff in and not removing it unless it's actively broken.


instructions
========

Don't use this. It's just for me.

 - check out repo in home directory
 - run `setup.sh`
 - forget this thing exists

 - when you get a new computer run `git add . ; git commit -m 'incremental'` on every box and deal with the horrible merge conflicts
 - forget this thing exists again.
